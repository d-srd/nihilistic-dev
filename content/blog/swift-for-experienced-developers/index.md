This is the first blog entry on The Nihilistic Dev.

It's created with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), the [Gatsby starter blog template](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), and a dash of existential dread.

The topics that will be covered will include:
* iOS 
* Swift 
* CI/CD 
* an occasional slow-cooker recipe
* functional programming
* declarative & reactive UI

See ya later alligator.
